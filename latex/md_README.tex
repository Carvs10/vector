\subsection*{1. Intorduction}

The Class Vector is a series of functions to manipulate vectors with different sizes. Also, you can use all the methods that normal class vector from std has. This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos. By building this, we want to see how works a class and all its methods developing them by ourselves.

\subsection*{2. The Algorithms}

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at {\ttfamily projeto\+\_\+\+T\+A\+D\+\_\+vector.\+pdf} file.

\subsection*{3. Compilling}

To compile this project, you need to\+:

{\ttfamily open your terminal}

{\ttfamily open the directory containing the folder vector}

{\ttfamily make}

{\ttfamily ./bin/exe}

\subsection*{4. Authorship}

This C++ class was developed by Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho and Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso.
